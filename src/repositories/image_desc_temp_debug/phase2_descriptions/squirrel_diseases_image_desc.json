  "image_description": "A detailed illustration of a squirrel in a forest setting, displaying signs of various diseases. The squirrel has unkempt fur and visibly drooping ears, with a worried expression on its face. Surrounding the squirrel are visual representations of common squirrel diseases, such as a faint outline of a tick, a small vial labeled 'Lyme Disease', and a shadowy figure of a veterinarian examining the squirrel. The forest background is lush with trees and foliage, but with some areas appearing wilted or unhealthy, symbolizing the impact of diseases. The overall mood is somber yet informative, with a focus on wildlife health awareness. The colors are natural greens and browns, with a slight desaturation to reflect the seriousness of the topic.",

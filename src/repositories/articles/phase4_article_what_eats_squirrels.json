This relationship is not just a simple food chain; it is a vital component of the balance of nature that sustains diverse ecosystems. Predators, such as hawks and foxes, play an essential role in controlling squirrel populations. Without these natural checks, squirrel populations could grow unchecked, leading to overpopulation and subsequent depletion of resources."
